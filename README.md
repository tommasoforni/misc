Little projects I did to learn python.
Some examples:
 - perceptron.py is a perceptron neural network that can be trained to approximate a given function ( such as sin(x) ).
 - qrect.py calculates the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the 2D Schrodinger equation in a box with a generic potential.
 - sim.py is a simulator for particles that interact through a time-varying Lennard-Jones potential. This was part of a school    project that consisted in modifyng the source code of [LAMMPS](https://lammps.sandia.gov/) to add a new interaction and        studying its effect. myLJ.pdf is the presentation we did for the course.
 - altitude.py takes a grid of altitude values and the position of a light source and outputs a picture of the 3D landscape        viewed from above using reflection.
